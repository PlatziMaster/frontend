## Frontend Challenge: Resume

### Local environment configuration
1. Create repository fork.
2. Clone repository to local.
4. Intall dependences and make necessary configurations.
5. Explore and check project structure and files.
6. Start coding! :smile: :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: :heartbeat: :heartbeat: :heartbeat:


###  1. Create components
Proposed components were created in a folder called *** "components" *** inside ***"src"***. Created additionals components for item iterations as children components.

### 2. Add styles
Added styles for all the components to get the desired design. I'm not so good at design but I tried my best.

### 3. Create getData.js function
The function was created to fetch data from the fake API.

### 4. Integrate API
Information gotten from the API after starting the test server is displayed in the corresponding components.

### 5. Custom API
***data.json*** file was updated with my personal information to fill the resume.

### Blocks and Solutions

The most difficult was to decide on a design. I like the design but I haven't too much knowledge about it, this is an ability I have to reach.
I solved it by looking for some resume templates on the web to get some ideas. :tw-1f60a:
