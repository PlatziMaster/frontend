# PlatziMaster Frontend Test

This is my application to PlatziMaster. I have learn many things doing this test. It's my first project in React and I think that it's a very good start.

## Process
1. I had to take some classes at Platzi to understand a bit of React logic.
2. Then I started looking at other Pull Requests to see how other people did it and I took one of them as a base to understand the creation of the Elements and the syntax.
3. I started to style my CV with some CSS. I reinforced my knowledge and dusted off some forgotten ones.
4. After I got it ready, I started to add my data. I also created the API to be able to visualize the information.
5. Then I decided to make it Responsive.
6. Then I tried to deploy in Heroku, without success (I promise to learn and do it).
7. I spent several hours in front of the console and StackOverFlow understanding errors and fixing them.
8. Finally I did the jest, finished fixing some bugs. Until it worked for me.
9. I made the fork to the original repository, uploaded the modified files to my repository and made the pull request.
10. Now I will wait impatiently for the results of this call. I definitely want to be a Master in development and I am sure that Platzi with its intensive program will help me to achieve it.

It is worth mentioning that this is my first project in React and I am very happy to know that I was able to fully meet the requirements. You are capable of doing anything you set your mind to and this is the proof of that.

THANKS PLATZI, YOU ROCK!
