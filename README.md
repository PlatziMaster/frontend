## Challenges and their resolutions 

***

1. Create the project components

The components  were created with React using the schedule proposed in the fork, and they implement Props (working with getData function and my API), UseEffect and UseState, they where planed in oder to overcome the test.

2. Add styles

The styles were implemented with Bootstrap and also inline styling was used whenever was necessary.

3. Create getData.js function

The components use the getData function which makes use of the fetch function and asynchronism.

4. Integrating API

The API  is deployed by executing  npm run server.

5. Custom API

The API was customized by adding my own information and my curriculum.
