      "paragraph1": "As a front-end developer with a background in UX/UI design, I bring a unique perspective to my work. I've spent several years honing my skills as a UX/UI designer, giving me a strong foundation in understanding user needs and creating intuitive interfaces. In 2018, I decided to shift my focus to front-end development, which I've found to be a true passion.",

My experience has given me the chance to tackle a diverse set of challenges, working closer with the UX and backend teams. I am driven by the need to solve problems, learn new technologies and work in a team.",
